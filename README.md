# AMP-Modification
<font size=3>The AMP-Modification pipeline utilizes a fine-tuned protein language model for the modification of AMPs through the integration of a genetic algorithm. It selects active peptides through the property-based model for positive physicochemical properties and the contact-based model combined with two distinct contact map filter approaches for positive structure constraints. In this pipeline, we take LBD (lipopolysaccharide-binding domain), a type of AMP, as an example for the antimicrobial activity improvement based on both the physicochemical properties and the 3D structures.
